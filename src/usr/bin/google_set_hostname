# /sbin/dhclient-scripts in both ubuntu and centos have some problems for us:
#  1) BOUND doesn't always set hostname (e.g. if old_host_name is unset in
#     precise pangolin)
#  2) Using too long of a FQDN as a hostname causes some tools to break in
#     some distros (e.g. ssh-keygen) and hostname tool complains when given
#     a FQDN that is > 64 bytes.
#
# As a result, we set the host name whenever a new host name is set - ignoring when
# old_hostname is equal to new_host_name's host part, to the truncated unqualified
# domain name.
