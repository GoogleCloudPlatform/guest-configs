gce-compute-image-packages (20200626.00-0ubuntu1) groovy; urgency=medium

  Google Compute Engine's upstream compute-image-packages project
  repository [1] has been split up to smaller ones [2] and this incurs
  the following packaging changes:

  - The Python libraries packaged as python3-google-compute-engine are
    not shipped anymore and the Guest Agent (written in Go) functionality
    and services are provided in the google-guest-agent package.

  - The libraries, applications and configurations for using OS Login is
    still shipped in the google-compute-engine-oslogin package.
    (It is built from the new google-compute-engine-oslogin source package).

  - The scripts and configuration files originally shipped by the
    gce-compute-image-packages package are now shipped in the
    google-compute-engine package.
